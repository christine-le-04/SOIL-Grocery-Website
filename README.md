# Soil Grocery Shopping Website

This website was developed for my Full Stack Development course alongside my partner. The website is a demonstration of our ability to integrate our front-end and back-end knowledge, showcasing our skills in developing a functional grocery shopping website. 

The website presents a range of key features that encompass both front-end and back-end development. Along other things, the front-end aims to deliver a user-friendly and responsive user interface, whilst the back-end aims to handle data processing and interaction with a database.
